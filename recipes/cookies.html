   <h2>A Tasty, Easy to Make Dessert</h2>
   <p>These 3 ingredient sugar cookies are a nod to the 3-ingredient peanut butter cookies you've probably heard ofâ€”they're super simple, and this small batch is easy to make in under a half hour.</p>
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li>1/2 cup vanilla sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup self-rising flour</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon nonpareils, or as needed (optional)</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Steps</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet or line with parchment.</li>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, beat the butter with an electric mixer until smooth. Add the sugar and beat until combined. Beat in flour until combined.</li>
    <li>Using a cookie scoop, portion dough 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges of cookies are set, about 14 minutes.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle immediately with nonpareils, if using. Allow cookies to cool completely before removing.</li>
   </ol>
